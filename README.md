### What's the application consists on?

With this tool, you can see images processed in realtime without lag. You can obtain a negative effect or a yellow-filter on it after the process. This application was originally made to see the benefit of the [Android AsyncTask Object](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask) available in the SDK (and to manipulate it). You cannot select your own images, some images are inside the application to quickly test it.

The application needs Android SDK v**15+** for working correctly (this project is compiled with Android **27**).
